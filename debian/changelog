  [ scragg0x ]
  * _convertRequest can use alot of memory on a bulk request and it occurs anyways for no real reason that I can see when _log == false.
  * Update lib/Elastica/Log.php
  * I was tracking down a memory leak and found that the curl handle was the source.  I honestly don't know what it's persisting.  In any case, I modified it to close the handle when it's done.  I don't think it will make a difference in performance to close/re-init in this case.
  * Turns out that returntransfer == true will leak memory.  I turned it off and used an output buffer instead.  I have tested it and it works.
  * I replaced the to(Camel|Snake)Case functions because it was using the e modifier with preg.  I disallow it on my web applications with Suhosin (because it's essentially like eval() which I also disable), so it was raising alerts and ending execution.  The changes give the same results and and are much faster.
